    # 1) pandas fast and efficient for dataframes
    # 2) We can open and examine csv and text files and save the results to these file types easily
    # 3) pandas makes our job easier for missing NAN data
    # 4) We can reshape and use data more effectively
    # 5) Slicing and indexing easy
    # 6) Help with time series data analysis
    # 7) Above all speed is a fast library with pandas optimized
