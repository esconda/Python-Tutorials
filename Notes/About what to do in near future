1)Continue to object oriented programming part like polymorphic infrastructure, friend class, encapsulation,abstraction and so on,it is necessary for bigger programs
2)Pandas library can read .h5, .csv, .json type of libraries, also check for it is possible to write not read
3)For larger dataset , get datas with list and convert it to dictionary then convert it to dataframa(panda like) infrastructure

5)Numpy is important type for image processing and it has many function in mathematical operations
6)Tuple is mostly not used
7)There are somehow restricted functions, They have many other functions to be used(Numpy,Pandas,Strings,List,Matplotlib)
8)There are other visualization tools better than matplotlib
